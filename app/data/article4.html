    <p class="article-text" style="font-family: sans-serif;">
        Ninjutsu is the foundation of all techniques in the Naruto universe, representing the mystical arts that ninjas use in combat. 
        These techniques, ranging from elemental manipulation to illusions and physical enhancements, are what make each ninja unique. 
        Whether itâ€™s controlling fire, water, earth, or wind, ninjutsu allows ninjas to perform feats beyond ordinary human capabilities.

        Each technique serves a specific purpose, whether in battle or for defensive measures. 
        The most famous ninjutsu techniques include the Shadow Clone Jutsu, Rasengan, and Chidori. Ninjas train for years to master these techniques, as they require immense skill and chakra control. 
        Ninjutsu not only determines the strength of a ninja but also their strategy in battle, making it a vital aspect of the Naruto series.
